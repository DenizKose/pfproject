Poison (damage type)
--------------------

Poison (trait)
--------------

An effect with this trait delivers a poison or deals poison damage. An
item with this trait is poisonous and might cause an affliction.

Polymorph (trait)
-----------------

These effects transform the target into a new form. A target can‚Äôt be
under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it
comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second
polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it
takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target.
Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical.
Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don‚Äôt allow the target to take
on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a
generic creature of a general type or ancestry. If you take on a battle
form with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only
by circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise
noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking and
using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there‚Äôs doubt
about whether you can use an action, the GM decides.) Your gear is
absorbed into you; the constant abilities of your gear still function,
but you can‚Äôt activate any items.

Positive (trait)
----------------

Effects with this trait heal living creatures with positive energy, deal
positive energy damage to undead, or manipulate positive energy.

Possession (trait)
------------------

Effects with this trait allow a creature to project its mind and spirit
into a target. A creature immune to mental effects can‚Äôt use a
possession effect. While possessing a target, a possessor‚Äôs true body is
unconscious (and can‚Äôt wake up normally), unless the possession effect
allows the creature to physically enter the target. Whenever the target
takes damage, the possessor takes half that amount of damage as mental
damage. A possessor loses the benefits of any of its active spells or
abilities that affect its physical body, though it gains the benefits of
the target‚Äôs active spells and abilities that affect their body. A
possessor can use any of the target‚Äôs abilities that are purely
physical, and it can‚Äôt use any of its own abilities except spells and
purely mental abilities. The GM decides whether an ability is purely
physical or purely mental. A possessor uses the target‚Äôs attack
modifier, AC, Fortitude save Reflex save, Perception, and physical
skills, and its own Will save, mental skills spell attack roll, and
spell DC; benefits of invested items apply where relevant (the
possessor‚Äôs invested items apply when using its own values, and the
target‚Äôs invested items apply when using the target‚Äôs values). A
possessor gains no benefit from casting spells that normally affect only
the caster, since it isn‚Äôt in its own body. The possessor must use its
own actions to make the possessed creature act. If a possessor reaches 0
Hit Points through any combination of damage to its true body and mental
damage from the possession, it is knocked out as normal and the
possession immediately ends. If the target reaches 0 Hit Points first,
the possessor can either fall unconscious with the body and continue the
possession or end the effect as a free action and return to its body. If
the target dies, the possession ends immediately and the possessor is
stunned for 1 minute.

Potion (trait)

Prerequisite
------------

Press (trait)
-------------

Actions with this trait allow you to follow up earlier attacks. An
action with the press trait can be used only if you are currently
affected by a multiple attack penalty. Some actions with the press trait
also grant an effect on a failure. The effects that are added on a
failure don‚Äôt apply on a critical failure. If your press action
succeeds, you can choose to apply the failure effect instead. (For
example you may wish to do this when an attack deals no damage due to
resistance.) Because a press action requires a multiple attack penalty,
you can‚Äôt use one when it‚Äôs not your turn, even if you use the Ready
activity.

under the effect of more than one polymorph effect at a time. If it
comes under the effect of a second polymorph effect, the second
polymorph effect attempts to counteract the first. If it succeeds, it
takes effect, and if it fails, the spell has no effect on that target.
Any Strikes specifically granted by a polymorph effect are magical.
Unless otherwise stated, polymorph spells don‚Äôt allow the target to take
on the appearance of a specific individual creature, but rather just a
generic creature of a type or ancestry. If you take on a battle form
with a polymorph spell, the special statistics can be adjusted only by
circumstance bonuses, status bonuses, and penalties. Unless otherwise
noted, the battle form prevents you from casting spells, speaking, and
using most manipulate actions that require hands. (If there‚Äôs doubt

adopting the structural requirements for being built there. The
structure adjusts around small features such as ponds or spires of rock,
but it can‚Äôt be created on water or other nonsolid surfaces. If
activated on snow, sand dunes, or other soft surfaces with a solid
surface underneath, the structure‚Äôs foundation (if any) reaches the
solid ground. If an item with this trait is activated on a solid but
unstable surface, such as a swamp or an area plagued by tremors, roll a
DC 3 flat check each day; on a failure, the structure begins to sink or
collapse. The structure doesn‚Äôt harm creatures within the area when it
appears, and it can‚Äôt be created within a crowd or in a densely
populated area. Any creature inadvertently caught inside the structure
when the item is activated ends up unharmed inside the complete
structure and always has a clear path of escape. A creature inside the
structure when the activation ends isn‚Äôt harmed, and it lands harmlessly
on the ground if it was on an upper level of the structure.

or more is even better‚Äîa critical success. If a stat block has no
success entry, that means there is no effect on a success.

Summoned (trait)
----------------

A creature called by a conjuration spell or effect gains the summoned
trait. A summoned creature can‚Äôt summon other creatures, create things
of value, or cast spells that require a cost. It has the minion trait.
If it tries to cast a spell of equal or higher level than the spell that
summoned it, it overpowers the summoning magic, causing the summoned
creature‚Äôs spell to fail and the summon spell to end. Otherwise, the
summoned creature uses the standard abilities for a creature of its
kind. It generally attacks your enemies to the best of its abilities. If
you can communicate with it, you can attempt to command it, but the GM
determines the degree to which it follows your commands. Immediately
when you finish Casting the Spell, the summoned creature uses its 2
actions for that turn. Summoned creatures can be banished by various
spells and effects. They are automatically banished if reduced to 0 Hit
Points or if the spell that called them ends. A summoned creature can‚Äôt
control any spawn or other creatures generated from it, and such
creatures return to their unaltered state (usually a corpse in the case
of spawn) once the summoned creature is gone. If it‚Äôs unclear what this
state would be, the GM decides.
